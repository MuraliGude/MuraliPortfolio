                    There are many different DC motor types in the market
                    and all with it good and bad attributes. One such bad attribute is the
                    lag of efficiency. In order to overcome this problem a controller is
                    introduced to the system. There are also many types of controllers
                    used in the industry, one such controller is PID controller. PID
                    controller or proportional–integral–derivative controller is a
                    generic control loop feedback mechanism widely used in industrial
                    control systems. A PID controller attempts to correct the error
                    between a measured process variable and a desired set point by
                    calculating and then outputting a corrective action that can adjust
                    the process accordingly. So by integrating the PID controller to the
                    DC motor we will be able to correct the error made by the DC motor
                    and control the position of the motor to the desired speed or point.

                    Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers [2] are
widely used in industrial control systems because of the reduced
number of parameters to be tuned. They provide control signals that
are proportional to the error between the reference signal and the
actual output (proportional action), to the integral of the error
(integral action), and to the derivative of the error (derivative
action), namely Where u(t) and e(t) denote the control and the error
signals respectively, and Kp, 'Ii and Td are the parameters to be
tuned. The corresponding transfer function is given as These
functions have been enough to the most control processes. Because
the structure of PID controller is simple, it is the most extensive
control method to be used in industry so far. The PID controller is
mainly to adjust an appropriate proportional gain ( K p ), integral
gain (K I ), and differential gain (KD) to achieve the optimal control
performance. The PID controller system block diagram of this paper
is shown in Figure 7and the simulink block diagram for the system
shown in figure 6 [5]and the block diagram result shows in figure
16.Transfer function can also be expressed as[1] The main features
of PID controllers are the capacity to eliminate steady-state error of
the response to a step reference signal (because of integral action)
and the ability to anticipate output changes (when derivative action
is employed Tuning the PID controller achieved experimental on the
plant .a lot of experiment has done till getting the best result
for Kp , Kd and Ki.
